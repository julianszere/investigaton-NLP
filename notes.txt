The `ln` command in Unix-like systems is used to create links between files or directories. It is typically used to create hard links or symbolic links (also called soft links).

Here's a brief description of what the `ln` command does:

1. Hard links: A hard link is a link to a file that points directly to the file's inode (a data structure that stores information about a file). Hard links allow multiple names to refer to the same file. If you make changes to the file using one name, the changes will also be visible when you access the file using the other name. To create a hard link using `ln`, you can use the following syntax:
```bash
ln <source> <link>
```
In this syntax, `<source>` is the name of the file that you want to create a link to, and `<link>` is the name of the link that you want to create. For example:
```bash
ln file.txt link.txt
```
This command creates a hard link named `link.txt` that points to the same file as `file.txt`.
2. Symbolic links: A symbolic link (also called a soft link) is a special type of file that acts as a shortcut to another file or directory. Symbolic links can be created across different file systems, unlike hard links. If you make changes to the file using one name, the changes will also be visible when you access the file using the other name. To create a symbolic link using `ln`, you can use the following syntax:
```bash
ln -s <source> <link>
```
In this syntax, `<source>` is the name of the file or directory that you want to create a link to, and `<link>` is the name of the symbolic link that you want to create. The `-s` option specifies that you want to create a symbolic link. For example:
```bash
ln -s /path/to/source /path/to/link
```
This command creates a symbolic link named `link` that points to the file or directory located at `/path/to/source`.

Note that when you delete a file that has one or more hard links, the file itself is not deleted until all hard links to the file are removed. When you delete a symbolic link, only the link itself is deleted, not the file or directory it points to.
